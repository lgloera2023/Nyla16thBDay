                    Happy almost sweet 16 prima! We're getting old! Did you know that you're about halfway through your teens? I would say that time flies, but high school felt a lot longer than four years for me. I pray you are soaking up every moment God gives you. I pray you wake up and say, "Good morning Lord!" instead of, "Good Lord! It's morning!" I am so proud of you for staying strong and fighting the good fight. Do not grow weary of doing good. Be everygrowing of God's holiness and love for you and our need for Him. In everything, Jesus is better. May He satisfy your soul and give you peace in Him. I pray God blesses you with a heart after Him. To another year of growth and service to God.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Luke Loera
                </p>
